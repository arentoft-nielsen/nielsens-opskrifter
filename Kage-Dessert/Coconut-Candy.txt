GOLDEN COCONUT CANDY

This is a Mexican convent recipe.

2 1/2 cups coconut, shredded
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup water
1 stick cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter
3 egg yolks
2 cup milk

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Place coconut on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil. Toast for 15 minutes, turning occasionally to brown on all sides. Cool and set aside. Grease an 8-inch square pan, line with parchment paper, then grease the paper.

In a large pot, combine sugar, water, cinnamon and butter. Cook over low heat, stirring gently, until sugar dissolves. Cover and cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes to wash down sugar crystals from sides of the pan. Uncover, stir in shredded coconut and, when it appears transparent, add the egg yolks beaten with the milk. Beat, stirring constantly, until the bottom of the pan is visible. Transfer into the prepared cake pan.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Bake candy for 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for 1 day. Cut into squares and wrap with plastic wrap. Place candy in an airtight container with parchment paper lining the bottom. Seal the container tightly and put in a dry place. The candy will keep for several weeks before you use it.

Makes 24 1-inch squares.
