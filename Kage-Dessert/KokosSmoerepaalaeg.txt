Ganache is a creamy chocolate mixture that can be used to frost cakes and other baked goodies, or can be hand rolled into truffles and coated with chocolate,
cocoa powder, coconut, or anything else you decide would taste good.

16 oz. white chocolate 
6 oz. coconut milk 
8 oz. shredded, sweet coconut

Melt chocolate in microwave or double boiler and cool to 90 degrees. Add coconut milk and mix well. Put mixture aside and let it set up. Do not refrigerate.
When mixture has set and is firm, place the bowl on top a double boiler or in the microwave until warmed throughout. Beat mixture until smooth and creamy.
Add the shredded coconut and mix well. The consistency should be like spreadable frosting.

Sri Kaya recipe
 

Ingredients
3 eggs
2 egg yolks
100 g castor sugar
50 g brown sugar
250 ml thick coconut milk, from grated white of 2 coconuts (If use cans, make sure it is 100% coconut milk extract. I used Ayam's brand 100% coconut cream)
3–4 screwpine leaves (pandan leaves), knotted

1. Set up a double boiler - fill a pot with water around 3/4 full and bring to boil. Once boiled, turn it down to low/medium heat, the water should be just simmering with bubbles at the bottom of the pot.
2. Use a large mixing bowl (I use a large metal mixing bowl), add eggs and sugar and beat them together until all sugar is dissolved.
3. Slowly add coconut cream into mixture while whisking until well combined.
4. Place the mixing bowl on top of the double boilder with simmering hot water.
6. Tie a knot of all the pandan leaves together, add it into the mixture. Use a silicon spatula and keep stirring.
7. Scrape the side and the bottom of the mixture with the spatula constantly and pour it over the pandan leaves. That way it will stop the mixture cooking too fast with lumps at the bottom, and the hot mixture will extract the pandan flavour from the leaves.
8. The mixture will start to get thick and sticky. Test the mixture whether it is ready by using "parting the sea" technique - draw a line by scraping the mixture in one swift move using the spatula. If you can draw a clean line on the bowl for a second before the mixture flows like lava and covers the line, then it is ready.
9. Once ready, remove it from the heat. Take the pandan leaves out and discard. (Make sure you squeeze all the sticky jam goodness out of the pandan leaves before discarding it)
10. Leave it cool and it will thicken further. Then fill in a sterilised jar and keep in room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the fridge up to a month. But seriously, you will finish the whole jar before you know it.
