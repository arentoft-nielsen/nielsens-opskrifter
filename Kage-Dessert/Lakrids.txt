Original Black Licorice

2½ dl molasses 
1 teaspoon (5 ml) powdered licorice root (or to taste) 
1 teaspoon powdered anise root (or to taste) / ½ teaspoon oil of anise
approx. 2½ dl wheat/spelt flour (enough to make a workable dough)
a dash of salt
black food colouring

?? TAN ??
1 dl sirup
40 g sukker
1½ tsk lakridsekstrakt
½ tsk anisolie
ca. 1 dl mel
sort slikfarve
1 knsp. salt

Blød lakrids består som hovedregel af 40% hvedemel, 40% sirup, 15% sukker, 5% rålakrids og andre smagsstoffer. 
Hvedemelet giver lakridsen den bløde og elastiske konsistens. Når hvedemelet koges med de andre ingredienser under høj
temperatur, bliver det til en hård klump. Klumpen bliver herefter trukket fra hinanden igen og igen til den bliver blød og elastisk.

************************************************
1.
Heat the molasses gently in a medium sized sauce pan for 5 minutes. Be careful it does not burn, and do not allow it to boil or bubble.
Cool. When it is still very warm, add the licorice root powder and the dried anise powder and stir well to incorporate the powder
throughout the mixture.

2.
Add ½ cup of flour to the molasses mixture, and stir in thoroughly. Continue adding flour, a few tablespoons at a time and up to 1 cup
total, until a thick, workable paste is formed
Take a small amount and roll it into a tube ~ ½ inch in diameter. Cut into desired lengths.

3.
Place on cookie sheets and allow to settle. The licorice will harden when cool.

TIPS:

In products such as licorice, gelatin, when combined with wheat flour acts as a binder greatly improving the moisture retention
preventing cracking of the sheets at the extrusion stage. Levels of between 0.2-0.6% w/w are commonly used.
The presence of gelatin also helps to prevent licorice products drying out in storage, improving product shelf-life.

Black Licorice candy
 
2 c. cane sugar
1 1/2 c. corn syrup
1 c. sweetened condensed milk
1 c. butter
dash of salt
1 tbsp. anise oil or about 2 to 3 tbsp. anise extract 
 
Cook at 232 degrees. Stir constantly. Do not wash sides of pan down. Pour into greased 9 x 13-inch pan.
Cool in refrigerator. Cut into bite size pieces and wrap in waxed paper.
 

Black Licorice candy II
 
1 cup (1/4 liter) granulated sugar
1/4 cup (50 ml) brown sugar
1/4 cup (50 ml) water 
1/4 cup (50 ml) light corn syrup
15 ml black food colouring
1 ml anise extract or pulverized anise seeds 
 
Put the sugars, water and corn syrup into a pot, set the pot over medium heat and stir. When the batch has boiled for the
first time, wash the sugar crystals down from the sides of the pot. Put the thermometer in the pot and cook without
stirring to 290F (143C) [soft crack stage]. Take the pot from the heat and add the food colouring and the anise flavouring
and stir them in gently. 

With a teaspoon, drop round patties about the size of quarters onto a greased baking sheet. If the candy in the pot gets too
firm for spooning, reheat it gently until it softens. Cool the drops completely but not in the refrigerator or the pieces
will stick. Wrap the drops individually in wax paper or cellophane.
